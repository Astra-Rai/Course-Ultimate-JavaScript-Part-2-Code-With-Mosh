/*

Notes: 

- enables to takeon the properties and methods of anthoer objects...
- this makes it easy to reuse code in different parts of an application
    example: Circle and Shape, both can use function: computeOptiumLocation()
- implementation method the same for both Circle and Square
- if there is a bug in implementation (computerOptimumFunction) or code needed to be added...
    we have to change source code in multiple locations

                                   Shape

                     ( IS-A Shape ) Circle      Square  

- shape 'class' : Base/Super/Paper
- Circel and Square: Derived / Sub / Child
- inheritance relationship referred to as IS-A

- Classical vs. Prototypical Inheritance
- JavaScript, no classes, JavaScript has Prototypical Inheritance
